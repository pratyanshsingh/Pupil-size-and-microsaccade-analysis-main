% [sphereValues]=ep_interpolateHead(dataIn, nSides, eloc);
% Interpolates the voltage values over a sphere representing the head.
%
%Inputs
%   dataIn  : The data matrix, where first dimension being channels.  The nature of the other dimensions don't matter.
%   elecInSphere   : The sphere vertices corresponding to the electrodes.
%   sphereCoords   : Coordinates for the all the vertices of the interpolated sphere.
%
%Outputs
%   sphereValues   : Voltage values for all the vertices of the interpolated sphere.
