%	%decimate the data to be appropriate for the summary figure plots
%
%Inputs
%   figureHandle:  the handle for the output figure.
%	displayPeriod:     The undecimated length of the data to be displayed (for one subject if average data).
%	totalDisplayPeriod: The decimated length of the data to be displayed (for all the subjects if average data).
%   decimateSamples:   number of samples to skip when decimating the data
%   titleList:  THe title of the subplot to be updated.
%   trialdata:   The new data (chans, timepoints)
%   EEGchans:    Array of EEG channels in the input data.
%   theSubject: which subject of the file is being processed.
%
%Outputs
%	plotData: decimated data for plotting in the summary figure (channels, timepoints).
