%	Detects bad channels and bad trials.  Bad channels have a
%	minimum/maximum difference over threshold.  Also, channels whose maximum difference from all other electrodes is
%   no smaller than a certain threshold is declared
%   bad.  Trials with too many bad channels (including globally bad channels) declared bad trials.  Also,
%   there is an option for trials with bad channels next to another bad channel (but not globally bad channels) declared bad trials
%   because they usually represent trials with generalized artifacts rather than isolated bad channels.
%   Not enabled by default as it generally turns out to be too stringent.
%   Channels that are bad on too many of the good trials are declared globally bad.
%   Criteria settings determine whether each of these considerations are applied and to what degree.
%   Bad trials (that is cells) not registered for average files.
%
%Inputs
%	inFile:     filename (not including the .mat suffix or chunk number.  e.g., "NT5") and sourcepath.
%	startChunk: starting chunk (usually 1)
%   endChunk:   ending chunk
%   badDataCriteria:  Criteria for detecting bad data.
%       .window:    moving average window for smoothing
%       .minmax:    difference from minimum to maximum for bad channel
%       .trialminmax:  difference from minimum to maximum for bad trial
%       .badnum:    percent of bad channels exceeded to declare bad trial, rounding down
%       .hminmax:   difference from minimum to maximum for bad horizontal EOG
%       .neighbors: number of electrodes considered to be neighbors
%       .badchan:   maximum microvolt difference allowed from best matching neighbor
%       .maxneighbor:   maximum microvolt difference allowed from best matching neighbor
%       .blink:     threshold correlation with blink template, 0 to 1
%       .detrend:   1 to detrend
%       .badtrials: percentage of good trials chan is bad to declare a channel globally bad
%       .replace:   1 to interpolate bad channels from neighbors.
%       .noadjacent:1 to not allow adjacent bad channels (trial or subject declared bad)
%   globalBadChans:   list of globally bad channels.  Will be set to a flat line.
%   editMode  : How to identify artifacts (automatic: use automatic criteria and enter marks into file; manual: use
%               existing marks in file; both: use existing marks in file and add additional ones based on automatic criteria)
%               (default: both)
%   theSubject: which subject of the file is being processed.
%
%   The input chunks include: dataChunk in EP data format.
%
%Outputs
%   outputLog: output messages from bad data process.
%   globalBadChans:   updated list of globally bad channels.
%   totBadChanNum:  Total list of bad channels (subject,trial,channel).
%   totBadTrialNum: Total list of bad trials.
%
%   Updated output chunks: dataChunk in EP data format.

% History:
%
% by Joseph Dien (2/09)
% jdien07@mac.com
%
% modified 3/19/09 JD
% Changed to use EP format data to provide more flexibility with I/O functions.
%
% modified 4/17/09 JD
% Treats flat channels as bad data unless they are a reference channel which is flat over entire dataset.
% Dropped eloc as separate input parameter (now part of data).
%
% modified 5/28/09 JD
% no longer zeroes out bad channels and trials, just notes them for later correction.
%
% bugfix 6/11/09 JD
% Was always applying no adjacent constraint even when option was turned off.
%
% bugfix 6/22/09 JD
% if no baseline set then will not try to subtract it (avoiding divide by zero error warning)
% Fix to badChanNum not being in right format, causing file not to be written out.
%
% modified & bugfix 9/18/09 JD
% Added support for multiple refChans to deal with mean mastoid data where the presence of the two reference channels (correlated -1)
% was causing ICA problems.  Trial specs coded only for single_trial data.
% Commented out setting bad trial code for "edit" field as was causing crash for non-EGIS files and
% not being used in any case.
% Was identifying wrong channel as bad when there was a flat channel and there was a reference channel with a lower
% number.
%
% bugfix 11/21/09 JD
% Replaced "union" commands with "unique" commands because certain situations caused the "union" command to crash in
% Matlab 2007.
%
% bugfix 12/3/09 JD
% Fix for bug where channel 1 would be marked as bad in too many trials if there was only one globally bad channel.
%
% modified 2/7/10 JD
% Changed bad channel field to negative numbers for still bad channels.
%
% modified 2/11/10 JD
% Will now work with subject average files with multiple subjects.
%
% bugfix 10/12/10 JD
% Fixed bad chan and bad trial fields not being recorded for all but last chunk when data are being processed as multiple chunks.
%
%  modified 10/12/10 JD
%  For continuous files, data now divided into one second epochs and can be artifact rejected in an epochwise fashion
%  in same fashion as segmented data.
%
% bugfix 4/18/11 JD
% Number of bad channels per trial in artifact correction log calculated incorrectly.  Artifact correction function itself not affected. 
% 
% modified 1/27/12 JD
% Eliminated REF channel type and added reference field to keep track of original and current reference scheme.
%
% bugfix 5/17/12 JD
% Bad channel field equals NaN in average files.
%
% modified 1/28/13 JD
% Added options for using manual edit marks instead of or in addition to automatic marking for bad channel and trials.
% Removed baseline correction as now performed as part of detrending step.
% 
% modified 9/22/13 JD
% Restricted blink correction to EEG channels.
%
% bugfix 12/28/13 JD
% Fixed crash when there are multiple global and trialwise bad channels when running under a version of Matlab earlier than 2013a.
%
%  bufix 3/11/14 JD
%  Handles decimal sampling rates gracefully.
%
% bugfix 4/8/14 JD
% Fixed crash when there are multiple global and trialwise bad channels.  Apparently Mathworks changed something again.
%
% bugfix 9/1/16 JD
% Fixed channels with large offsets being erroneously tagged as being bad channels due to filter edge artifact.
%
% modified 9/2/16 JD
% Check for difference from inverse of all other channels too since channels in sparser arrays can end up being the only opposite polarity waveform.
% Baseline correct with first sample for each epoch when applying maxneighbor criterion so simple offset does not trigger it.
%
% modified 4/26/17 JD
% Adjusted "too many bad chans" criterion so not rounded off and also based on total EEG channels rather than all channels.
%
% bugfix 4/2/18 JD
% Fixed not outputing to log correct mean number of bad channels for average files.
% 
% modified 6/23/19 JD
% Accelerates artifact correction by adding option to keep chunks in RAM.
% 
% modified 7/28/20 JD
% Can now handle NaN data values.
